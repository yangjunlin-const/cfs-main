/**
 * A {@link Writable} which is also {@link Comparable}.
 * <p>
 * <p><code>WritableComparable</code>s can be compared to each other, typically via <code>Comparator</code>s. Any type
 * which is to be used as a <code>key</code> in the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework should implement this interface.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Note that <code>hashCode()</code> is frequently used in Hadoop to partition keys. It's important that your
 * implementation of hashCode() returns the same result across different instances of the JVM. Note also that the
 * default <code>hashCode()</code> implementation in <code>Object</code> does <b>not</b> satisfy this property.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 *     public class MyWritableComparable implements WritableComparable<MyWritableComparable> {
 *       // Some data
 *       private int counter;
 *       private long timestamp;
 * <p>
 *       public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
 *         out.writeInt(counter);
 *         out.writeLong(timestamp);
 *       }
 * <p>
 *       public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException {
 *         counter = in.readInt();
 *         timestamp = in.readLong();
 *       }
 * <p>
 *       public int compareTo(MyWritableComparable o) {
 *         int thisValue = this.value;
 *         int thatValue = o.value;
 *         return (thisValue &lt; thatValue ? -1 : (thisValue==thatValue ? 0 : 1));
 *       }
 * <p>
 *       public int hashCode() {
 *         final int prime = 31;
 *         int result = 1;
 *         result = prime * result + counter;
 *         result = prime * result + (int) (timestamp ^ (timestamp &gt;&gt;&gt; 32));
 *         return result
 *       }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote></p>
